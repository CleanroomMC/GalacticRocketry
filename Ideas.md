# Decoration
* Walkways with and without pipes/cables within (ceu framed pipes style?)
* Airlocks - GC style
* Pipe/cable passthrough walls (eio facade style?)

# Mechanics
* Asteroid Mining (but actually automatable!)
* Gas Giant Siphoning
* Interplanetary Item Transport via Railgun (and earlier on by rocket?)
* Oxygen sealing rooms needs to be performant
    * Doorways/airlocks must be part of sealed area so players don't die when moving between two sealed rooms
* Asteroid belts
    * Mostly "standard" asteroids by default, some rare ore rich ones
    * Define the weights and sizes of all of them
    * Generate in world, you can go there
    * Automatic asteroid miners, set up in the dim but don't mine in world
    * Mining ores automatically: CEu's bedrock fluid veins.There's a certain production rate, better miners deplete it slower and/or make more. You can fully deplete some veins, but others are set to have a "depleted" rate. You can also make them replenish over time if you want. Depletion of 0 is allowed.
* No sound without an atmosphere without suit upgrade. CONFIG.
* Dyson Swarm (?): have it be an alternative to OP mek fusion as an endgame energy source


# Gating
* Based on distance
* Make a second planetary system an order of magnitude further than another, which effectively gates it until better components.
* A tier better thruster would be required to get there etc.
* System -> System puts you on an "edge" of the system
* Rocket Shielding: Solar temperature, Venus Temperature, Mars temperature, Kuiper Belt Temperature, Acid, Black Hole, Asteroids, Pressure, and maybe some others
* Space suits protection tiers, less hard required, not recursive


# Cosmic weather effects
* Config for in-world destruction.
* Ways to protect yourself.
* Some way to gate it before they start happening.


# Space Stations
* Freeform structures of whatever you want
* Make them habitable, oxygen sealing
* At later tiers you can fly it around
* Low gravity recipe requirements
* Gates initial access to planetary interacting devices/machines, such as weather control, gas collection, mining, etc
* Lower gravity than the planet they orbit, extend rocket max ranges, use less fuel
* Station to station transport should get an extra discount
* Move to "deep space" for true void base
* Planet scanner: scan the world and get huge general regions with material contents. Orbital miner mines from those only. You choose their names, contents, etc on a per planet basis.


# Cross Mod Compat
* Specify any dimension as a planet, add the planet-specific data to it regardless


# Planets
* Plant/non entity life
* New structures: crashed probes, ships, and more
* Very hot planets make reactors unstable, very cold ones keep it cooler
* High pressure planets allow compressing coal to diamonds
* Planets should unlock new powergen and new rocket fuels


# Early Game Progression: Furnace - Rocket
* Coal fueled generator
* Chemical Reactor for rocket fuel
* Bauxite Ore for aluminium, main material for that point in gameplay
* Other materials, machines, recipes TBD


# Logistics
* No energy, item, fluid transport
*
